141519,47,"To get straight to the point, this ice maker delivers on its promise to make small ice bullets within 9 minutes. In my initial test it made the first batch of cubes in about 9 minutes and 30 seconds, which is within the margin of error in my opinion. The machine itself isn't silent, but stays at a modest hum which shouldn't irritate anyone while it runs.<br /><br />As long as you run the self-cleaning, and clean it a sufficient number of times on first use (seriously, go overkill with this if you want the ice cubes to taste proper), and plan to use the ice cubes promptly or otherwise put them in a freezer shortly after they are made, this machine will work fine. Where I feel this machine is lacking is in the details.<br /><br />The ice cubes themselves are deposited into an ice cube tray at the front of the machine over the water reservoir. By design, this is one big chamber with water at the bottom, so it doesn't actually chill the entire chamber. If it did, the water would freeze at the bottom. This means the ice is free to start melting as soon as it's dropped into the tray. It will last a little while as new ice continues to cycle into the tray, but ultimately will wind up melting back into the reservoir, meaning that if you leave the ice maker running indefinitely, it just keeps refreezing the same water over and over again. This is extremely inefficient in my opinion.<br /><br />I also really dislike the drain plug. It's a non-issue if you plan to freeze every last bit of water, but if there's anything to drain at the end, it is literally just a giant plug you pull out of the bottom. When I did this the water kind of went all over the place while I got the plug out of the way, and then it just drains rapidly as it's literally just a sizable hole--no slow drain mechanism or mini-pipe with a plug at the end, or anything really that would help you direct the water flow. Considering how easy it would have been to improve what I feel is a vital function for an appliance that potentially deals with a large amount of water if filled to the maximum level, this is a major detriment.<br /><br />Overall, it DOES deliver on the ""ice within 9 minutes"" selling point, so I can only recommend this for occasions where you need a good deal of ice that will be used quickly. Since it can't maintain the ice it generates for an extended length of time, it's absolutely not a daily driver, or a replacement for a fridge with an ice maker built in. Please use that information to determine if this is the right machine for your needs.",4,4
654332,47,"This is a fairly straight forward repair, but you do need the spanner wrench as well, which is sold on Amazon.<br />NOTE: you DO NOT need to remove the outer mounted (black) tub for this repair. Only the inner tub needs to be removed.",1,5

Very happy with this purchase, I’ve been using it everyday for the past weeks and so far so good.",5,5
146705,47,"The pitcher just arrived. It's packaged in a box, wrapped in a plastic bag. This would only be a problem if the carrier mishandles it or, if like mine, Amazon included no stuffing or bubble wrap. (Mine arrived in good condition.)<br /><br />The pitcher is clearly labelled on the inside and fits my thermometer just fine. The intended use is for making lattes and cappuccinos in the mornings. I bought this to replace an 8 oz. X-Chef pitcher which turns out to be too small for my espresso machine, which has a very powerful steam wand.<br /><br />As usual, I washed both pitchers before using, towel-drying the outside, and letting it air dry. No rust, so far, and the stainless looks nice.<br /><br />I will supplement this review after I've used it for a while, and will note any deterioration in the pitcher or if it has other failings.<br /><br />Update: I’ve had this pitcher for several months now. There are no signs whatsoever of rust or any other defects. I use it daily, hand washing and air drying it after each use. It’s perfect for steaming 8 oz of milk, with plenty of room for foam and it makes pouring easy.",5,1

236942,47,I was so excited to buy this because I had my eye in a machine for a while. When an influencer swore that it was amazing and had a great discount code I ordered immediately. Horrible decision. The machine WOULD NOT make any ice. We asked to return it and we’re told it would cost us $70 to return it. We got this for $150. Rip off! Go find a better machine,1,1

It keeps me cooking because I can just cover up the cooktop when I'm done, and has a lot of other great benefits like the heat resistance (in case I forget that hot burners are hot), keeping my cooktop away from my negligently tossing things on the counter forgetting there's a GLASS SCRATCHABLE SURFACE THERE, and being generally really very pretty.

258396,47,"I just purchased this machine recently because the laundromat is just getting too expensive and time consuming. I haven't used a laundromat in years and it's just not convenient when you have to let laundry pile up for a week or two! In-home laundry is much better but since I downsized to a cheaper apt I don't have machines. I used this little guy today for the first time and was pleased with the results. Of course the sink adapter leaked from my kitchen faucet but i'll play with it to see what helps. I only connected one water line to the cold intake because my faucet is a single piece design. I can control the temp of the water with the faucet. More importantly, the machine washed clothes nicely, didn't leak on my floor and wasn't noisy. The controls are a bit confusing but once you get the hang of it, it seems great. i tried the normal wash with some t-shirts and a couple towels and it became unbalanced during the spin. Easy fix but the clothes were sopping wet when i took them out, as if the water didn't spin out. Maybe the load was too small or the water level too high. I tried the cottons program on my second wash, filled the tub almost full of clothes and the clothes spun out nearly dry. They're on a rack in my bathroom right now. It'll be an experiment to see what settings work best. I have the machine on a small appliance dolly because it's a bit heavy, but it got wobbly when spinning so maybe i'll just deal with the tiny rollers on the bottom of the machine instead. Overall I'm really glad I purchased this machine, it holds more clothes than I anticipated. The laundromat will only be for big stuff like blankets or comforters now. Shipping was fast too! UPS brought it right to my door.",5,5

If you have a bag of lettuce or have to get something in the back, forget it, you have to take the WHOLE bin out.  For someone who likes fresh veggies, it's a lot of work.  Having problems with the icemaker too.  It won't dispense because the ice cubes are stuck to each other.  We had to dump the whole thing out and start over.  Storage is nothing special either.  It doesn't have the flexibility of adjusting half-shelves like you find in french door refrigerators.  It is also noisy.

Not difficult, just takes some patience and time. Turns out my thermal fuse was the culprit, but there's a reason this failed due to high heat and could be a bad thermistor, so just replace all of them while you have the unit apart. little money and will save you time down the road...kind f like a 100k mile service for your dryer :)",5,5

The dryer stopped working after about a year and it took the technicians from the retailer several trips to figure out how to fix it. The dryer also takes a long time to dry and only has one heat setting. When clothes come out, they don't have static which is nice. It is nice because it saves space, but it does not save time. Since there's only one machine, you can't wash clothes and dry clothes simultaneously since you have only one machine. Overall, I would not recommend it because of the issues with the dryer functions.",5,5

I always thought people were making too big of a deal about dyer fires because of lint buildup, but now, after using this brush  I can see how  easy it would be for a spark to start a fire.  ** SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND: Be sure to turn your dryer on  and go outside to the exit vent where dryer air escapes from vent hose, because even though this brush loosened and grabbed a lot of lint, my exterior  vent on the outside of my house had a huge clump of lint that had been loosened by the brush stuck just inside the vent .",5,4

603867,47,I bought this in March and it has been a such quarter saver. Granted you have to put at least two to three shirts. It can wash jeans but you have to do it one at a time. The problem for me which was the outlet in the apartment was in a weird angle of the room. The plug isn’t long but using an extension cord did the trick. Just don’t be like me and putting it inside the sink where it did fall down a few times. Even with all that fall damage (that’s a lot of damage) it still washed. The thing I will say is this is meant for a temporary use. What I mean by that is the washer will over heat after the third to fourth  wash. I would let it cool down or just wash the next day. Don’t be like my fiancé and throw five to six shirts in there. That’s just going to over heat the washer and it won’t spin properly. As for soap I would add about two to three tea spoon of it. If you add too much those soap suds will take forever to wash off and it’s a pain to rinse water in there at times. Now that I moved into the house I’m using it one last time since we got a washer. Was this portable washer worth it? For me it was. I learned a lot about portable washers lol. If you’re willing to give it a chance or wanting to save a few quarters this is a nice investment. I hope this helped for someone that is deciding in buying it.,5,2

I am sure you are aware there is filter material and media that can do an incredible job of cleaning water.

21601,47,"When I bought my Faberware Classic Yosemite I saw this filter and decided to give it a go. First of all to get free shipping I had to spend $25 dollars and the percolator was only $20.97. Shipping was going to be $7.35 but the filter was only $5.41 this is a no brainier.<br />After reading reviews and seeing where it is recommended that you use paper filters which you will need to punch a whole in the middle of to keep grounds out of you coffee I'm thinking it sure would be nice to not have to buy paper filters. It is not like they are expensive but at some point you run out. You ever dripped coffee through a paper towel? It cost less than shipping so how can I go wrong? But I do know I don't like grounds in my coffee! I will get those paper filters if I need them.<br /><br />Three year warranty is pretty strong on a $5.41 item! but does it work.<br /><br />First of all if you do not use coarse ground coffee you will get a fine sediment in your coffee. However it will not be chunky grounds. Use coarse ground coffee and this problem is very minimal. Another trick I learned is after you brew the coffee and before you pour it up pour a little cold water in the percolator. Don't worry the coffee is plenty hot this will not be a problem but that shot of cold water settles the sediment to the bottom of the pot. Unless you pour up every drop of coffee from the pot, problem solved.<br /><br />Now about that three year warranty, haven't had mine for three years but. It is just plastic with a mesh screen can you tear it up heck yes would not be hard at all. They are not warranting it against abuse if you drop a heavy pot on it or poke holes in it with a fork I doubt they will send you another one. What they are saying is if you don't step on it or poke it with a knife you want wear it out in three years, I'll buy that. Of coarse it will cost you more to ship it than replace it.<br /><br />I am glad I bought mine, works as advertised, if it does get mangled in the dishwasher I will buy another one.",5,5

At first my wife was skeptical of it's awesomeness but within minutes we had ice and before we even realized we had a bucket full of ice.  You don't realize how nice it is to grab a shovel full of ice and walking away without having to refill an ice tray until it becomes a normal facet of life.  We rent an apartment and the fridge doesn't make ice so this is the next best thing to that.  It's larger then I pictured it but the convenience is amazing, I brought it to our holiday parties set it on the floor filled it up and let it make ice for us the whole time, it was a big hit.  Personally on a man level, I bought it because I know I can run this thing with my smaller inverter generator in my jeep which means I can bring it camping with me (please note if you tip it or shake it about a lot it's best to let it sit for 2 hours before operation), which equals free ice as long as I have a clean source of water, during Hurricane Sandy the fact that we had stored a ton of ice in our freezer kept all our food cold for the week or so we had no utility power.  It can be noisy when it's pulling water, I guess as noisy as a water pump can be, nothing unusual.  Sometimes when I'm napping the ice dropping in the basket kinda snaps me too, all these things are petty background noises I've quickly become accustomed to but I guess someone new to the ice maker should realize is part of the show.

306084,47,"First off, I had the panda washer and knew I wanted a panda dryer since I had such a great experience with it. The washer I have has a 10lb capacity and can fit a load directly from that to the dryer except for pants. This machine takes the same amount of electricity as my washer 850W which typically a dryer can take from 1800w-5000w, so if your thinking you can do a load of regular clothes in the typical 45min that a big washer does I think you need to bring down your expectations. If you want to dry quicker I recommend you get a more powerful dryer though it'll probably cost you a good $100 more and will sort you more on your monthly bills. As well as the size of dryer based of in person measurements are 23 1/2 tall 19 1/2 in wide 13 in depth. Inside the drum is 9 1/2 inches deep. As for nosie level it is very quiet that I don't even hear it running till I hear some buttons clank around the drum. In the manual they say it takes typically 1hr for clothing to dry on high heat on the hottest setting or 100min on the medium heat setting. I personally always have the button down for high and use the hottest setting(the red bar) and time myself for 30min, once the timers up I'll take out the clothes and whip them out straight and flip them inside out or right-side out and set another 25min. (Very important to flip them because it can drop the drying time by like 20min) I can wash 3 thick work pants with a pair of socks and undies and drying time takes about 1hr 25min or so on high/hot heat. But that is some really thick material. As for rags they take like 20-25min on high/hot. Shirts take 45min on high/hot. As for blankets I can fit a full bead spead with 3 pillow cases minus the comforter in and dry in about 30 to 45min so long as I whip them out and flip them halfway through on high/hot. Now for regular everyday jeans it take about 1hr and 5 to 10min to dry on high/hot. I personally wanted the smallest dryer I could find since I'm limited in space. And I wanted something that can take the amount of clothing my washer washes and so this fit all my needs. Plus, it came as a vent kit combo so I liked that I wouldn't have to spend money separately for that. But if your washer takes more than 10lb of clothes you might want to get a bigger dryer. Or if you want it to dry sooner than an hour than maybe one that is more powerful than 850w. But from the perspective that most big 1800w+ dryers take 45min to dry and this is only 850w I feel like it's amazing so long as you realize what you are buying. Also an important thing to note is that I realized the white felt like bit in the filter does need to be cleaned as well as with the filter for consistent heating I use a lint roller to clean it. Also I tried using 2 dryer balls to reduce heating time but only later learned 3 to 4 are recommended for small to medium loads and now see about 20min shaved off the drying time.",5,5

However, the product works perfectly.  The seams are strong and the perfect thickness.  Adjusting the heat setting solves every problem based on the thickness of what you are sealing.  I recommend this product to other users.",3,5

More research online resulted in a branding website bragging about how they threw together the licensed farberware name in 14 days. The BBB has an F rating with Edge Consumer Brands for numerous other complaints. Steer clear of this unit. No one wants to take responsibility and they will certainly not honor any sort of warranty which they are required to by law.

I have dried a lot of clothes and blankets and generally it has taken an hour and a half to dryer a mixed load woth jeans in it. Tonight I dried a blanket and it took less than 30 minutes. To say I am pleased is an understatement. It holds everything that my Kuppet washer can wash at what time. I have noticed that the lint filter can be a pain to clean, but I have pets and their fur is crazy. I have been using the vacuum to clean the filter, which works great. Honestly 10/10.

I called a couple of my buddies and they said quit being lazy, so I got tuff ordered the belt and prayed that it wouldn’t show up. But it did…on a Sunday. Now I’m stuck. So I unhooked the water hoses and drain hose, unplugged it, shoved the dryer out of the way. Tipped it over, not as heavy as you would think. Then I used my cell phone light to see the old belt and it was tore up. Guess smashing the comforter in there on top of a week’s worth of towels probably wasn’t a good idea. But it did seem like a good idea at the time! So I pulled the old belt off one handed and wiped everything thing down with a dirty black face cloth. I put the belt around the little motor pulley and got it started on the bigger pulley, I had to work it around a couple of times spinning the bottom of the drum to get it in all the grooves. I wish I had shot a video of how easy this was, but it happened so fast it was over and I was washing clothes in minutes!

Purchase at your own risk.<br /><br />Update:  Opal asked us to return for a replacement.  Straight out of the box the replacement machine does not recognize when it is out of water so it keeps trying to pump when no water is in it.  Now 6 weeks later machine will not make any ice.  Opal now wants us to &#34;scrap&#34; this machine so they will send third one.  My take away is this company will keep replacing machines until the year is up and you are out of warranty.  $500+ and a ton of time wasted for a year of ice.....,1,1

An unbalanced (or excessive) load of clothes could cause the drum to wobble excessively (which could damage the unit) and never get up to speed.<br /><br />Essentially, try to keep the clothes along the wall of the ""drum,"" with the heaviest articles of clothing on bottom and the lighter clothes on top.  Try to spread the clothes as flatly and as neatly as is reasonable (areas of the clothes that are thickly ""bunched-up"" along the wall tend to remain more damp after the spin).  The clothes should form a tube up the wall with a hollow center.  Folding the clothes into a strip helps avoid bunching-up.  Also, try to balance the articles on opposite sides of the drum (put one sock opposite another sock, etc.).<br /><br />In addition, if you place a wringed-out article of clothing on one side of the drum, wring-out the article on the opposite side (sopping wet clothes on one side can cause wobble).<br /><br />I have found that only one or two heavy pieces are possible in the Nina Soft for it to start spinning without violent wobble.<br /><br />I have also discovered a special trick to balance denim jeans -- put the seat section on the center bottom of the drum, and spiral the pant legs up the sides of the drum.  Then, without adding any more clothes, spin the pair of jeans alone (with the ""protective disk,"" of course) for about twenty seconds to get rid of the excess water.  Then, stop the spin and shove the seat of the jeans along one wall and add more clothes, with care to add a little more weight to the side opposite the jeans seat.  Then, spin as usual.<br /><br />It's too bad that Mueller didn't include a manual power switch (or a timer).  The instructions actually have one plugging the unit into the wall socket with the lid closed, which starts the spin.  However, such a procedure could cause mild arcing at the wall plug, which isn't too great.  I have a short extension cord with an in-line switch, and it works well.  Of course, when the lid is opened during the spin, the Nina Soft's internal switch cuts the power to the spin motor, and when the lid is further opened, a friction strap brake closes around a flywheel to stop the drum from spinning.  I flip the switch on my cable and let the motor spin down a little before I open the lid, to save the brake.<br /><br />One more thing, the water sprays wide out of the nozzle and off to one side a little.  So, get a wide, round, plastic bowl or shallow tub to catch the water.",4,5

59106,47,".....for that matter, it’s the worst dishwasher I’ve ever seen.  I purchased the predecessor to this machine two years ago, and have had one problem after another with it.  Even when it is working, which is rare, it’s a horrible piece of equipment.  The drawers don’t drain properly and it always stinks.  Getting it worked on is a nightmare.  The nearest dealer is 50 miles away and they’re not anxious about working on equipment purchased through Amazon.<br /><br />After struggling with this horribly designed thing for two years I’ve decided it just ain’t worth battling it any more.  I’m junking this POS and getting a traditionally designed LG like I have at my beach house.  It’s half the price of this junker and is a far superior machine.<br /><br />If you’re thinking about buying one of these, do yourself a favor and forget about it.",5,1

33942,47,Works great ! Water tastes great again. Thanks!,5,5
393172,47,"So far, so good.  It was installed 2 days ago.  Runs off 110 current, cleans well on normal setting (43 minutes) with cold water.  After reading reviews, I bought heavy rubber vibration pads to play it safe considering the high spin rate.  Has run 4 loads without a hitch.  Capacity seems adequate, much more compact than the agitator washer it replaced.  If stackable, this could be a boon.  Updates will be provided if needed.",5,5
77727,47,I have been using the filters for years and have been very satisfied with the quality 😃,5,5
502328,47,"I topically don't have the time to write reviews but I have to leave a few words regarding this device. THIS THING WORKS! I managed to clean about 12' of duct: one 65 degree bend and a 90 degree bend, without any issues. The amount of lint and dirt that this device collected was insane. So, do yourself a favor if you love your family and cherish your property and safety! Clean those vents every year or two! I used a cordless drill. This made it very convenient and helped getting it around the turns. I'm very satisfied with the item and like others have said in their reviews, my drier works more efficiently now and dries faster.",5,5

345778,47,"Took this camping and had great coffee whenever we wanted. Kept the kettle on the fire and just poured over more coffee whenever needed. This was my first experience with a pour over, so dont have much to compare, but this worked well.",5,5

307813,47,"My Whirlpool came with a bad belt. It lasted two years but it squealed from time to time. One day it made a horrible sound, smelled like burning rubber, and no more washing machine. My dear husband got this kit, spent about 15 minutes under the washer and it has never run better or quieter than this. It took longer to detach the water and reattach it than it did to install this whole kit. For under $20, I have a new and improved washing machine.",5,1
483408,47,Very satisfied with the quality and performance! Awesome anesthetics at very reasonable price.,5,5

40634,47,"I wanted to make using my reusable k cups as easy as possible, so I bought these. When I remove the used filter from the k cup, only a minimal amount of ground coffee is left on the top of the k cup. I’ve bought these twice and I’ve only ripped one getting it out of the package, so they must be durable. I will continue to buy this brand",5,2
669789,47,"although this item was wrapped in its own cellophane bag, the pull up handle was missing from the filter.  i don't really need it anyway, but i think if it is advertised with it, it should have had the handle.  therefore, i knocked off two stars on ""easy to use"" since it would probably be easier with the handle.  screams sloppy quality control.  i'll just keep it, because i wouldn't have used the handle.",4,4
423333,47,"As a Chemex pour over user, the duty to discard thick paper filters has been daunting. This alternative is better than any reusable filter I’ve had for any brewer to date. The dual layer approach is effective and the composition is sturdy enough to clean out with a rubber spatula without deforming the filter. I foresee the top gasket failing early and hope replacements are available, but otherwise a well executed product.",5,5
622143,47,"This motor seems a little heavier than the original, but it fit perfectly. The wires were not all in the same position as the original, but it still works like the original. I guess it is wired to fit multiple models. It doesn’t come with the rubber grommets that cushion the mounting so be sure and save the old ones.",3,4
604233,47,Used it for the first time today and it worked great!  I was a little surprised how quick it produced the ice.  Definitely recommend it!,5,5
240099,47,Great price for this double package,5,5

122494,47,"I have been using this product for less than a month now, and realize that this product is not fully heat resistant.  I followed all protocols that the flame should not touch the material.  I cook at a low to medium heat.  Unfortunately today I saw the burnt out spot.  A waste of money.",1,1
251118,47,"I weighed trying contact paper or other options, but liquid stainless seemed the most likely to succeed. Sadly the results are not great for me. Maybe I should have sanded my dishwasher door more, or tried a roller. I did about 10 thin coats, I sanded a few times in between latter coats--which helped, but the end result still has horizontal lines throughout.  The company customer service always answers the phone quickly and was helpful. It was a fun project but I don' know how to get the end results that others have described.",5,5
128510,47,I love that the top comes off for easy cleaning,5,5

304786,47,I had new countertops installed and the installers forgot to install the dishwasher mount and I didn't catch it until after they had left.  I have a friend thats a plumber and he told me about these.  I'm only 2 months in and they are still holding great.  Will let you know 6 months from now on how they're holding up.  AWESOME PRODUCT!!,5,5

60976,47,"Just as advertised,  great long lasting filter",5,5
270481,47,This part was received quickly! I watched a “how to” video to replace it. I couldn’t have done it without that! Was easy!,5,5
253524,47,Used product once. Midway through our evening it had leaked all CO2 out and stoped working. Having to replace parts since it wouldn’t let me message seller.,5,1
448035,47,Looks just like the OEM part,5,5
618066,47,The kit came well packaged with a new heating element (the part I needed) and 4 sensors (thermostats or fuses)  I assume 2 of these are for different models as my dryer only has a thermostat and thermal fuse.  The exterior vent had completely clogged and the lint - it's everywhere - apparently caught fire in the heating chamber.  That's probably what broke the element.  It doesn't explain why the fuse didn't blow.  Poor design on the part of Samsung I'm guessing.<br />I watched a vid on UTube to see how to do the job.<br />Note that the UTube vid said to pull-out the dryer and remove the rear access cover to release the heating chamber.  That was not necessary.  You can do the whole job from the front.  To slide the heat chamber out I had to remove the support bracket.  Remove the 2 screws on the bracket foot and tilt it back to release the 2 tabs on the rear foot.  You have to be forceful to tilt it back.<br />The parts in the kit fit perfectly and would have only taken about a half-hour to replace but I spent about an hour cleaning out lint everywhere.,5,5
655819,47,We wearied of all the Kcups we were using.  Four or five a day adds up.  These reusable pods combined with the disposable paper filters make clean up a breeze with no environmental problems. They're great!!,5,5
400119,47,"I bought this because I unfortunately have to place my washer outside. It's a touch screen and not meant for outdoor usage. The cover is very helpful, it does get some leaks, but it could also just be from using it outside.",5,5

423464,47,"The products looks great and feels Sturdy when you first look at it. But after just 3 weeks of use, it broke down. When I took it apart, it was clear that a piece of metal was inserted between the two functional pieces (of plastic) to give it a ""sturdy"" feel.<br />I almost feel duped !",3,5
386693,47,It is the perfect size for my tiny place and holds just the right amount of what i need stored in the freezer,5,5
512441,47,Our washer came with the house and when we got it the pump was broken. Lived with it unknowingly for several years. After replacing it the difference was noticed by more accurate timed cycles from the washer. Everything took much longer than stated with the old broken pump.,5,5

104730,47,Water is just as good as it is with the filter costing three times the price.,5,5

362366,47,"It's advertised as a dryer latch kit, but I used it to fix an old Sears metal kitchen sink cabinet that had the same type fasteners.  Will work for dryers too!",5,5
283843,47,"My dryer's location called for venting it to the side instead of the default rear venting. The installers did not see to this, so when I learned that a kit was available to accomplish side venting (which the dryer's documentation described), I got it to do the job myself. It was fairly straightforward, but be advised that you have to work through one or two holes in the dryer's fuselage, which can be awkward, especially if you also have space constraints as I did.<br /><br />My principal grievance is that the supplied exhaust duct was not quite long enough to make fitting the connection to the wall vent easy. It should be another 1/2-inch longer, maybe 3/4-inch. I was able to make it work but only by reaching in through the now-disused rear hole to manually push the exhaust duct farther out through the new side hole long enough to secure the flexible exhaust tube to the duct.<br /><br />Another gripe is that securing the joints inside the fuselage with duct tape is easy to show on the instruction sheet but difficult to accomplish in the real world given the access constraints. I got it done but it's ugly (fortunately hidden from view inside the dryer's fuselage).",4,5
497964,47,"I gave this a low score due to the engineering of the part as it will fail.<br />This is my 3rd one.<br />But the part us a perfect fit, but there is no option for a better part.<br />The Manufacturer should redesign the part",5,2

209145,47,"The filter leaks water. I tried tightening to the maximum, however I did notice there is a difference between the original filter screw and the Waterdrop screw.

650969,47,"Fan is a tad noisy at times and the noise seems to come and go. Since it is in the garage it is no big deal.<br /><br />The short return tube is just pitiful. I barely get it outside of my 3 tap tower and then it gets in the way of the keg sitting under it. However it does work, in fact here in the south I have a constant trickle of condensation on the outside because it is so cold.<br /><br />I would buy again if ever needed.",4,5
99476,47,"I immediately knew this wasn't a good fit.  I was able to install but it was extremely difficult.  When I ran first dryer load, it didn't sound right...was clearly not good.  Ended up returning and bought a generic belt at Lowe's, which works and does so quietly.  I do not recommend buying for the subject dryer.",1,5

581727,47,"Bought this a few months ago, but just started using it recently.  Well-made, easy to clean, great value for money.  I'm saving money by using my own bagged coffee, and don't have to worry about filling the landfills with all those plastic kcups.  (I still will buy a box of kcups if I find my favorites on sale, but this is a great money-saving alternative to buying kcups exclusively).",5,5

225173,47,I do not remember where I bought these hoses.  I bought my house five years ago and right after I moved in the washing machine hose leaked all over the floor.  I went to one of the local stores and bought these hoses unaware of the check valve in the inlet.  Today I just installed a new washing machine and tested the water flow by letting it run into the tub when the hose shut off.  I thought I had a calcium buildup problem.  It turns out that these hose have a check valve in them.  Once I discovered this I connected the hoses to the machine and turned everything on.  It is now working but the flow is slow.  I would never had noticed it except for the discovery of the valve.  These hoses worked just fine with the old machine so they must be producing the same amount of water for this machine.,5,5

336728,47,Picture is deceiving. There is only one piece. When I took down my previous range hood filter it had two pieces. A grease filter and what looked to be a charcoal filter. The charcoal filter was pretty thick metal with charcoal pieces inside. The product I purchased from Amazon is just the grease filter. It looks like it might have a charcoal lining of some sort but very thin. Maybe this is how they are made now. This product fit loosely on my range without the second piece but seems to be okay. Just not sure if I need that heavier filter.,3,1

It did arrive damaged with some dents on the front panel, and we were disappointed by that. However, after contacting customer support, we had perhaps the best experience ever dealing with a company. They took personal, full responsibility for something that quite likely happened while the item was being handled by the shipper. We chose the % refund option.

Weight and measurements of the solenoids were spot on.<br /><br />Only slight issue was the bracket that holds it to the fridge was slightly bent. Not enough to prevent replacement (the valve now sits on a slight angle when attached) and it didn’t affect the function.<br /><br />Better than some universal kits that use compression couplings… this uses the same type of quick connect coupling on the OEM valve.<br /><br />Dispenser no longer drips, and it’s way cheaper than the OEM replacement.",4,5

357388,47,"The Cilio has made some of the best coffee I've tasted.  Make sure you preheat the Cilio before using.  I've tried several methods for brewing coffee including the ones shown on youtube.  One of my favorite methods is to have two measuring cups.  In one cup I place 16oz. of filtered water and preheat to 205 degrees.  In the other measuring cup I scoop six tablespoons ground coffee. I have placed a #4 filter in the preheated Cilio and placed it over my coffee mug.  I then pour the preheated water into the measuring cup with the coffee grounds,stir for ten seconds and then pour into the #4 cone filter. Fantastic!  Taste just as good or better than the Aeropress. If you don't preheat thye Cilio the water cools off to rapidly before it drains from the bottom.",5,5

548272,47,"AMAZON: YOU REALLY NEED TO LET PEOPLE GIVE “0 STAR” REVIEWS. Needed a small dryer for my apartment. This worked great for not quite a year & a half, at which point it started tripping the GFI switch on the outlet. The switch tested fine; the lint traps, filters, and dryer vent are cleaned/changed on a regular basis. The first time it happened, 3 months ago, I noticed the vent had become slightly dislodged from the dryer. I reconnected it and relocated the dryer, in hopes of preventing the vent from being dislodged, again. Afterwards, the dryer stopped tripping the GFI and worked just fine - until today. I called customer support and was informed the vent was likely never the problem: it was more than likely a faulty internal part pulling too much current and I will have to call a service technician, at my own expense. 1) I guess I’m lucky I had it plugged into a GFI so it didn’t catch my apartment on fire. 2) DOESN’T ANYONE BELIEVE IN QUALITY, ANYMORE?????? I am absolutely LIVID that this didn’t even make it 2 years without crapping out, AND WHAT IF IT HAD CAUGHT MY APARTMENT ON FIRE!?!?!? SCREW YOU MAGIC CHEF!!!!

389725,47,This is an inexpensive replacement part however expensive replacement parts are not very expensive either. I do wish the part fit more like the original but it will do the job and you don’t look at it so you have to ask does it really matter?<br />Truth be told this magnetic catch does not allow air inside the washing machine to prevent mold or mildew. To do that you must leave the door wide-open and your machine will remain clean and problem free. While I awaited the replacement part the machine functions perfectly without it. So the magnetic catch is a convenience to avoid the clunk noise I’m closing the door completely… A nice touch by LG,5,5

394742,47,"I bought these replacement charcoal filters for our Cuisinart coffee maker.  Reviews for the coffee maker raved about how the filters make a difference and help you start with good water to get good taste.  We had a Braun coffee maker for decades with no filters and we have hard water, and I don't taste any noticeable difference now with filters, so I can't rave, but they are not very expensive and certainly can't hurt.<br /><br />Charcoal should take out off-odors, some impurities, etc., but I don't know the efficiency of these little filters.  I suspect that when the filters that come with the coffee maker reach their end, you could just take them out (don't leave them there forever, they could eventually leak charcoal dust into the coffee which would be annoying, or maybe get moldy) and run it without any filter cartridges at all, but again, they probably help some and can't hurt and they are not expensive.<br /><br />They make a more noticeable difference if you have water with odors (sulfur, etc.) than they do with mine.

They're more expensive, but we're getting such good results with them on the Normal wash cycle, we're going to keep using them. We thought our previous washer was quiet, but sometimes we literally don't realize it's running until it pumps the water out and we hear the gurgle coming from the sink drain.

If you look at the picture on the box, you see the black cone-shaped piece which helps distribute the water throughout the coffee . Without it, you get a bitter cup of coffee. Moreover, water splashes or drips everywhere as it goes through the drip process.<br />The first time I purchased one of these filters I got two of them from Amazon for about $13 each one for me and one for my girlfriend, which worked great.  My girlfriend's lid broke after a couple of years of use, which prompted me to buy another to replace hers. Walmart had these for approximately  $5; so thinking ahead, I bought four of them, only to discover the flaw of the missing diffuser under the lid.<br />Furthermore, to prevent breakage, I found that rinsing the device verses banging on the side of the sink or some other hard surface is more effective to remove the coffee grounds and prevents damage to the lid.

322842,47,"So after searching multiple websites and parts distributors to make sure this was the correct replacement switch for my cook top, I ordered it. I also watched a video produced by GE regarding the replacement and installation of the new switch. The whole process should have taken about 20 minutes. I ended up taking the switch out because it would only install one way and I could only put the stove knob on upside down. When I tried to turn the switch 180 degrees I found three of the wires would not reach to their connectors. Upside down, the switch works, but the burner only makes heat on 8 and above. Somewhere around 8.5, it goes from luke warm to infinite high. So now I don't have a burner that takes itself from simmer to high without moving the knob, I have a burner that will only work on the settings from 8 to HI. I'm at kind of a loss now whether to order another switch and try again, or just call a repair service and let them worry about it.",4,5

159100,47,"As other reviewers have noted, this filter does not have sufficient capacity for many 10-12 cup percolators. It would be nice if they offered more than one size.<br /><br />Also, I find that I have had to increase the amount of coffee I use in my percolator (an old Corningware 10-cup model)to get the right strength--I think it's because the filter is so small in diameter that some of the water misses the basket entirely during the perking process (Pouring a half a cup of the just-perked coffee back through the grounds creates a stronger brew, but who wants to do that every time?).  People with other makes of percolators may not experience this problem.  If I could control the length of the perking cycle this problem might be resolved, but I can't.  With coffee so expensive, it's aggravating to have to use more!<br /><br />I used to have a wonderful old percolator (I think it was a Presto)that had both a fine in-spout strainer and an adjustable strength setting.  It kept the grounds out of my coffee and I could control the length of the perking cycle.  I wish they still made it, because it made perfect coffee with any grind.",3,2

305172,47,"I'm very pleased with this fan, but I had to reverse the direction.  My old Nutone vent hood contained a fan that mounted with the motor below the fan blade, and looked almost the same as this one.  However, out of the box, this fan is wired to be mounted with the fan on the underside and the motor on the top.  In my installation, the fan was upside down, blowing instead of sucking.<br /><br />To reverse the direction, you have to unscrew the two screws on the end of the motor, pull off the bearing cover, then flip over the magnet (see photo).  Screw it all back together, and the motor will spin in the opposite direction.  It took me about five minutes.  Search youtube for Yb_k6gxNej0 and you will find the howto video that I followed to make this happen.<br /><br />Works great!  Light a match and blow it out to see how the smoke draws.

My utility room was too far from an outside wall to vent outdoors, and the previous owner of the house vented the dryer in between the floor upstairs (where the utility room is located) and the ceiling of the downstairs room.

It was delivered we haven't touched since the day it was delivered and opened the box and it is unusable.  There was no damage on the box to make us think and now that we finally have the space to get to it it is ruined.  Oh and now that we are looking at it more it wouldn't have been useable even without the dent.  The filter covers that are supposed to be removable to replace the filters are broken and stuck and do not match the manual description of what they are supposed to do.  Worst purchase ever!,1,4

649078,47,Some people complained that the color did not match their other appliances. You have to take into consideration that there are more than eight different shades of stainless steel and obviously some colors will be darker or lighter. In my case since Miele dishwasher is using lighter stainless steel it did not match perfectly however I really liked the little color difference as it gave this dishwasher new and refreshed look. Bearing in mind that Mila wanted $525 for the panel this $29 beautiful stainless steel looking paper is an obvious winner.  It was very easy to put on from the first time with no problems whatsoever.

I've used these filters and the original Pur filters in the past with no problems and I've used other brands when they started pricing these too high.  The flavor of the water after replacing my filter recently is terrible.  I don't know how you can ruin a water filter but they did.  I won't be buying another one and will go back to using the Swift brand which was equivalent and tasted normal.  Maybe I got a bad one but I won't be buying again. One strike and you're done.

I took a chance and installed without the O-ring.  The filter did not leak and is operating fine.  I followed up with an e- mail to the vendor and was informed that the O-ring was no longer needed based on a design change.

Well, everything bad that I read about these filters and the design of their use is true.  The filters themselves don't stay in their little basket, they float up.  That's even after soaking them the recommended amount of time and after several pots of coffee.  The little basket they are supposed to fit in in nearly impossible to insert at the bottom of the reservoir for this model, and the tools that came with the filters are all but useless.  Also, no instructions came with them.  The reservoir is so narrow that in trying to insert the plastic basket by hand, I scraped the back of my hand several times.  Not worth the blood and aggravation!  Also, yes the basket does not sit tight in the hole where it goes, so water passes around the basket instead of through the filter.  Basic hydraulics indicate that water will flow in the direction of least resistance, so most of the water probably doesn't even go through the filter. The design could have been so much better.",1,5

Can't believe I waited so long to try to fix it myself.  Bought ice trays and had been manually refilling them for about a year after the icemaker died.  What a hassle (and waste of freezer space.

399310,47,"It's a great replacement, official Whirlpool product, came with all connectors attached.<br />My side by side fridge stopped cooling and was getting warm, fan and compressor on backside bottom of fridge were both working fine... the fan above the evaporator coils (inside the freezer panels) was not turning and had ice buildup on coils, disconnected thermostat wire from the fan, used a jump wire to ground out that one terminal to the fan and it started working. That was enough to keep fridge cool until I received the replacement thermostat. Thermostat is mounted on the coils near the top right just below the fan motor, it's held on with a clip and can be easily removed. Two days later I got the replacement, one of the connectors went through the back of the fridge and is hooked up to NOTHING, probably a service port or something. Instead I just cut the wire on the inside and connected the new wire to it with a screw-on wire connector, hooked it up... fan didn't turn on right away but after a few minutes it worked! Let it run overnight just to make sure before I put all panels back together. Tucked wires back in place and secured with new supplied tie-wrap. All good!",5,5

I NEVER write reviews of anything but I am still so happy with this machine. Love it!!!! We're retired and it's just the two of us! This little washer is a dream come true. I have not gotten this for free, I paid for it. I use it every couple of days...put it right in my shower and I recycle the previous rinse water to use for the next wash. Don't fill it too full with the clothes and it washes great. The spinner does such a good job that the clothes are almost dry when they come out. Just want I hoped it would be! I wanted to get a second one as a spare but it is no longer available! Please get them back, Amazon!<br /><br />I have been using this washer for a few months now and I am still loving it! I have learned some little tricks to make it easier and less noisey and it has worked out great so far. It has paid for itself since I dont have to go 20 miles to the laundermat anymore. Don't overfill it with clothes or they dont agitate well. You may have to hold onto the washer until the spin dryer gets to spinning fast. I found that I never have to spin anything more than 2 minutes and the clothes come out slightly damp. I hang them out and that's it.Now that it's summer I have mine outside under the patio roof.

275519,47,"This is the second stainless steel filter I have used.  I use paper filters with both of these steel filters.  I feel the coffee's flavor is better when this product is used than my first filter.  This filter is easier to clean and use than my first one with the plastic diffuser on the top.  I believe this filter produces better results due to the lack of drains on the sides of the body.  This forces the brewing water to flow through a single path top to bottom through the depth of the coffee grounds and not through side drains of my previous model.  I believe this is closer to the way water flows through a one shot K-Cup cartridge and therefore produces a better robust flavor.  The only issue I have encountered is an occasional drip from lid fill hole or rim.  This may be due to my use of a paper filter with this product and is also present in my first steel filter.<br /><br />(Update)<br />I've been using this product for a while now and I am still getting good results consistently with it.  It appears to be more tolerant of my high filling of the &#34;Simple Cups&#34; paper filters I use with this.  I did not even notice the one time a paper filter &#34;blew out&#34; because the grounds were well contained within the bottom of the stainless steel filter.  I am still convinced that my &#34;Fill N'Save Elite Series Stainless Steel&#34; filter is an improvement to my previous stainless steel filter.  All though these improvements are minor, I still prefer using this product to my previous Stainless Steel filter.",4,5

230032,47,"[[VIDEOID:3d11ef082b215ecb42060e81ef757aa2]] Let's start by saying this isn't advertised as a $500.00 washing machine. It is in the $20 range and for me, worth it. They describe it as a ""dishwasher and washing machine."" I've used several items like this or very similar. This one seems fairly sturdy and functions as described (I've used this one once so far.) I've used these types of washing items for washing small, lightweight clothing as well as similar item to wash dishes. For small lightweight clothing it functions the way a standard washing machine does as it agitates the clothing and water. The difference is that you have to do the rest such as rinsing and wringing out.<br />This item has several modes. Automatic (goes through all cycles), agitate only, (rotates), ultrasonic vibration only (used in some dishwashing items) and bubbles only.<br />For small lightweight clothing, the agitating works great. When I use as a dishwasher, I sometimes use automatic (but since it doesn't have a fan guard, sometimes the dishes bump into the rotation.) I also use the ultrasonic vibration alone for dish washing with soapy water. While this doesn't clean like a standard dishwashing unit costing hundreds of dollars, I think of it like I'm soaking the dishes in a ""super soaking"" mode. This allows me time to do other things in the kitchen while the dishes are getting fairly clean. I've also noticed similar items that are advertised as ""portable sink dishwashers"" that only have the ultrasonic vibration feature and sells for more than double. So for me, this is fairly priced and seems to do a decent job.",5,5

172955,47,Works but needed to be modified for my fridge. I guess that since this auger fits many different models some are more tolerant than others. After I pulled it apart I noticed a gap that was about 1/4” different than the one on the original that I was replacing. There are 2 flat sides where the teeth slide onto the end of the auger and they needed to be about 1/4 longer because when I put it back together the auger would barely spin. I took it back apart and filed down each side about 1/4 inch more so the teeth could slide down further. It worked perfectly and I’ll include a picture of the file that I used. It was only a small inconvenience and it took about 10 minutes to file it down.,5,3

630557,47,"If I was writing this review after 2 years of ownership I would have given it a 5, but after 3 I would give them a 1.  I started having problems after 2.5 years.  First the circuit board that handles the controls, then the fan and a circuit board/heater in the back of the unit.  I was able to do some of the repairs myself with the help of their service group.  It is clear they must have a lot of problems, when I called their service number and started describing the issues they were not surprised and they were somewhat familiar with the issues I was having and they tried to be helpful.  The issue is their service group just hasn’t received enough training, their instructions were always a little off and the diagrams weren’t always correct.  On top of that it is just a poorly designed unit.  This is a wine cooler and I did mention (heater) above.  Their process for getting the red wine section to the right temp is to cool it down using the compressor that cools the beverage section and then heating it back up.  The repairman that I finally called said he had never seen anything like this.  I paid him his service fee and he quoted me a price to fix it and it just wasn’t worth it.  He gave me 3 brands that he thought were very reliable and Edgestar was not one of them.",5,3

668186,47,"I've had this range for about 2 years. My kitchen only has space for a 20&quot; range, and this matched my other black/stainless appliances. I'm giving it two stars because the oven, and all the burners, are still working (see UPDATE). Otherwise, here's my experience... This is not a good stove for people who like to cook and bake. It is very cheaply made, light, and flimsy. It can't take constant cleaning. It seems more appropriate for heating pre-made foods. Wiping the stove down with kitchen spray cleaner has resulted in all the numbers around the dials wearing off. I now have to use an oven thermometer to set the proper temperature to bake. The oven arrived with a gasket to seal the oven door. That burned up the first time I baked. Although I keep a foil pan at the bottom of the oven to catch spills, and clean my oven monthly, the panel that makes up the floor of the oven has rusted. I noticed visible drip stains behind the glass of the oven door. There's a small glass panel, held by 2 screws and metal washers on the interior of the door. I removed that, cleaned it, reinstalled it, and still saw the stains. Came to find there is a gap between the top of the door and the door glass, that will catch anything that spills from the stove top. Cleaning it requires dismantling the entire oven door. Nothing sits level on this stove. I ended up putting a metal &quot;stand&quot; under the center of the 'far too thin stove top to support pots and keep them from sloping down. I'm not sure what grade of stainless steel the stove top is supposed to be, but my stove top developed rust stains. I have to sand it with emery cloth to keep it from looking like I have burnt grease on it. On a more positive note, it does look nice when it's clean and as I said earlier, the oven and burners all still work. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this range.<br /><br />UPDATE: 10/02/2018: AS of now, I have one burner not working. The oven door will no longer stay closed on it's own and requires I prop something in front of it while baking/broiling. When I think that I replaced a stove that was almost 50 years old, with one that couldn't last 5, I know this stove is really a piece of.... well... just look for something else. I feel like, for the price, I leased a crappy stove for a couple of years, and have to go look for a new one. Not the way to buy major appliances. Resist any temptation to purchase this stove.

If you don't have an extensive shop supply of tools and press parts , I would recommend getting it as well.
